# Capstone-Creeper-Game-2026

## 📖 Overview

**Creeper** is a turn-based abstract strategy game where players compete to expand their influence across a grid-based board by placing pins (characters) and forming a continuous path between opposite sides of the board. Rather than direct combat, the game emphasizes **gradual expansion, positioning, blocking, and strategic foresight**. Victory is achieved when a player successfully connects their designated edges of the board.

Our version reimagines this abstract gameplay through a **Lord of the Rings–inspired theme**, where the conflict is represented as a struggle between **Light and Shadow** spreading their influence across Middle-earth.
